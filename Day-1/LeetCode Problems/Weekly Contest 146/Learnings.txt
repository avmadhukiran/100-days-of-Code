vector:: assign() is an STL in C++ which assigns new values to the vector elements by
replacing old ones. It can also modify the size of the vector if necessary.

Emplace back - constructs and forwards (faster)
    - use for complex data strucuture when move is not necessary
Push back - constructs and copies into temp and moves the value
    - little slow because it does un necessary copies

 emplace_back() vs push_back()
When we use push_back(), we create an object and then insert it into the vector. 
With emplace_back(), the object is constructed in-place and saves an unnecessary copy

tie()
The work of tie() is to unpack the tuple values into seperate variables. 
There are two variants of tie(), with and without “ignore” , the “ignore” ignores a particular tuple element and stops it from getting unpacked.
